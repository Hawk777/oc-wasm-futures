About
=====

OC-Wasm-futures provides a collection of async futures for use in Rust code
running on [OpenComputers](https://oc.cil.li) computers running the
[OC-Wasm](https://gitlab.com/Hawk777/oc-wasm) architecture. These futures are
designed to work with any async executor and provide more ergonomic ways to
handle sleeping and making method calls.
